% ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH
% -------------------
\abstract

Highlights are often the things people remember from sporting events and are memorable even years after the event has taken place. In the world of e-sport, games such as Counter-Strike 2 the statement also stands true. In this study, we use a proof of concept and mixed-methods approach with surveys and interviews to compare our algorithm with an existing highlight tool, and present a new algorithm for creating highlights that take into account many different metrics to calculate the better moments of a game of Counter-Strike 2. We will also look into metrics, how important they are, how players with different knowledge of the game rate them, and how an algorithm can be created to find highlights in Counter-Strike 2. The findings that we uncovered were an alternative algorithm with a slight edge of preference over the existing highlight tool and an unanswered question about preference when it comes to highlights between novice and experienced players.
