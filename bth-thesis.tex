\abstract
\textbf{Our text:}\\
Highlights are often the things people remember from sport events, and are memorable even years after the event has taken place. In the world of e-sport, games such Counter Strike 2 the statement also stands true. We present a new algorithm for creating highlights that takes into account many different metrics to calculate the better moments of a game of Counter Strike 2.
\\\\
\textbf{Their text:}\\
Most readers will turn first to the abstract of your thesis. Use it as an opportunity to spur the reader's interest. The abstract should highlight the main points of your work, especially the thesis' problem statement, methods, findings, and conclusions. However, the abstract does not need to cover every aspect of your work. The main objective is to give the reader a good idea of what the thesis is about.

The abstract should be completed towards the end when you are able to overview your project as a whole. It is nevertheless a good idea to work on a draft continuously. Writing a good abstract can be difficult since it should only include the most important points of your work. But this is also why working on your abstract can be so useful -- it forces you to identify the key elements of your degree project.

Structured abstracts have several advantages for authors and readers. They help readers to quickly find information in an abstract and also guide authors in summarizing the content of their manuscripts precisely. Below you find the main components of a structured abstract.

% THE ACTUAL THESIS STARTS HERE
% The chapters below are just suggestions and need to be adapted to your topic.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:introduction}  % labels are used for cross references
\section{On the content}
Your introduction has two main purposes: 1) to give an overview of the main points of your thesis, and 2) to awaken the reader's interest. It is recommended to rewrite the introduction one last time when all writing is done, to ensure that it connects well with your conclusion.

\emph{Tip}: For a nice, stylistic twist to create a connection between your introduction and your conclusion you can reuse a theme from the introduction in your conclusion. For example, you might present a particular scenario in one way in your introduction, and then return to it in your conclusion from a different -- richer or contrasting -- perspective.

The introduction should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The background for your choice of theme
    \item A problem statement that defines the scope of your thesis
    \item A schematic outline of the remainder of your thesis 
\end{itemize}


\section{Background}
\textbf{Our text:}\\
In Counter Strike there are two teams, the Terrorists (T) and Counter-terrorists (CT). The game is focused on the T side planting a bomb at one of two sites, and the CT defending that site and defusing the bomb. This game is highly mechanical, meaning that its skill ceiling is very high. Each game in Counter Strike 2 is play with first to 13, with 12 round halves. There is overtime if the score is even after 24 rounds. Overtime consists of 3 rounds per side, with the first to win four rounds winning the game.
\\\\
All tournaments have different group stages, but most if not all use the single elimination bracket for the playoffs. Meaning there is a quarter, semi and final rounds, often best of 3 wins in the quarter and semi-finals and best of 5 in the finals.
\\\\
Millions of players tune in to watch professional matches, with the highest peak viewers up close to 3 million(2.75) people watching. This game was the PGL major in Stockholm, during the finals, when G2 faced NaVi, and the game was very close, going all the way to game 5.
\\\\
In the world of Counter Strike, there are a few moments that all players of the game are familiar with. These are often plays that work against all odds, with everything at stake. A few of these moments are when the players such as S1mple, during ESL One New York 2016, throws his AWP, the best gun in the game to confuse his opponent on dust\_2, or the one where Twistzz just pushing through the defense on the map Nuke during IEM Cologne 2022, or, probably the most iconic of all, Coldzeras B site hold on the map mirage, at MLG Columbus 2016. He single handily stopped Team Liquid from winning the game, with the score at 15-9 for Liquid. This, combined with the skill and luck involved, makes this probably the most recognized Counter Strike highlight of all time.\\\\
Team liquid is approaching bomb site B with all of its members through what is called apartments. Coldzera is holding this part of the map scooped in with his AWP. The first player leading the push gets spotted by Coldzeras and gets eliminated. The four remaining members of Team liquid starts pushing toward Coldzera as he repositions to a new spot. Coldzera then does the most unthinkable play in his position and jump fires without scoping his AWP significantly decreasing the accuracy of the gun. He eliminates two opponents with this risky play and with only two opponents left he finishes off the fourth opponent with a quick no-scope and his teammate TACO eliminates the last standing member of team liquid. \\\\
They go on to win that major, many thanks to this play. Highlights like this are what most people watch competitive e-sports for, and if you watch the highlight, you can hear how the crowd loves the play, and the casters are impressed.\\\\
Most players playing Counter Strike, have these moments themselves, perhaps with less on the line, but the feeling of holding down a part of the map by yourself, is a great feeling. Some people compile all of their best moments into a highlight reel to upload for people to see. Our question is, can we find these highlights by analyzing the game, and find better highlights for a given round, in a given game from a given player. We are going to research if that is possible, how that could be done, and if getting highlights from your own matches, improves enjoyment of the game.\\\\
A highlight is when something extraordinary occurs during a time period or an event. In the case of Counter-Strike 2 a highlight could be a multitude of things, for example a round when a player kills multiple players in one round or a player kills more than one player with one bullet or a single utility.\\\\
A lot of things occur during a Counter-Strike 2 match, meaning it can be hard to decide what highlight is better than another. In a single game, multiple highlight worthy moments might happen, such as in one round a player might eliminate the whole enemy team, while in another round a player might kill three players with one grenade. It is here the algorithm comes in and values each play with different metrics and can decide which round would be better to make a highlight out of.\\\\


\section{Defining the scope of your thesis}
\textbf{Our text:}\\
This thesis will focus on the creation of our new algorithm and the empirical research we have conducted to create a better algorithm for finding highlights in the video game Counter Strike 2. The thesis will also research if there is a noticeable difference between what a novice player and seasoned player of the game prefers in a highlight.

\chapter{Related Work}
\label{chp:relatedwork}
\section{On the content}
\textbf{our text:}\\
In the article \cite{Tgwri1s2017} by Tgwrils (2017) we can further research into how the new rating system works and this gives us a better insight of how we can rate our metrics for the algorithm. The rating system is explained in the article as rating performance and not rating individual highlight moments. It focuses more on the overall performance of a player over a match. 
\\\\
In the paper \cite{Rubin2022} by Rubin, A. (2022, January 13). There are a lot of useful metrics and data we can use, such as what is the most significant factor for a team to win a round, Rubin presents data that show that the team's equipment value is one of the leading causes for a chance to win. This information we can take into account when creating our new algorithm. We can for example interpret this as if a player with poorer equipment value eliminates the enemy team, it is higher valued in the algorithm than if the player had more valuable equipment.\\\\ 
It is also stated how they analyze data from games and parse the demos they collected, which is of great use to us as we also need to collect similar data.\\\\
In the article "On broadcasted game video analysis: event detection, highlight detection, and highlight forecast" by Chu, W.-T. and Chou, Y.-C. (2016) they go over the topic of highlight detection which is appropriate for us. They go over metrics such as motion intensity, frame dynamics, number of gamers, event ratio, number of viewers chat and number of emotion symbols. All of these metrics might not be possible to collect as we are not analyzing a live event where there are any active viewers or interaction with any chat or crowd. As the article does however cover the topic of arousal of viewers, it is worth studying as the purpose of a highlight is to create excitement.\\\\
In the paper  "Automatic soccer video analysis and summarization," by m A. Ekin, A. M. Tekalp and R. Mehrotra (2003). We get to read on how a very different sport handles video analysis and summarization of games. The text is interested in the sense how other sports/activities can be analyzed and what to can be looked at, for example in the article there is mentioning of slow-motion segments which could also be used in highlights to show the event in more detail.
\\\\
In the master thesis "CS:GO Player Skill Prediction" \cite{BaranNama} we get to read about 
\\\\
The articles mentioned covers different aspects of analyzing games via metrics, this relates to our work as to find highlights we need to analyze the game similarly.
