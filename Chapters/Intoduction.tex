\section{On the content}
Your introduction has two main purposes: 1) to give an overview of the main points of your thesis, and 2) to awaken the reader's interest. It is recommended to rewrite the introduction one last time when all writing is done, to ensure that it connects well with your conclusion.

\emph{Tip}: For a nice, stylistic twist to create a connection between your introduction and your conclusion, you can reuse a theme from the introduction in your conclusion. For example, you might present a particular scenario in one way in your introduction, and then return to it in your conclusion from a different -- richer or contrasting -- perspective.

The introduction should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The background for your choice of theme
    \item A problem statement that defines the scope of your thesis
    \item A schematic outline of the remainder of your thesis 
\end{itemize}


\section{Background}
In the world of Counter Strike, there are a few moments that all players of the game are familiar with. These are often plays that work against all odds, with everything at stake. A few of these moments are when the players such as S1mple, during ESL One New York 2016, throws his AWP, the best gun in the game to confuse his opponent on dust\_2, or the one where Twistzz just pushing through the defense on the map Nuke during IEM Cologne 2022, or, probably the most iconic of all, Coldzeras B site hold on the map mirage, at MLG Columbus 2016. He single handiley stopped Team Liquid from winning the game, with the score at 15-9 for Liquid. This, combined with the skill and luck involved, makes this probably the most recognized Counter Strike highlight of all time.



Team liquid is approaching bomb site B with all of its members through what is called apartments. Coldzera is holding this part of the map scooped in with his AWP. The first player leading the push gets spotted by Coldzeras and gets eliminated. The four remaining members of Team liquid starts pushing toward Coldzera as he repositions to a new spot. Coldzera then does the most unthinkable play in his position and jump fires without scoping his AWP significantly decreasing the accuracy of the gun. He eliminates two opponents with this risky play and with only two opponents left he finishes off the fourth opponent with a quick no-scope and his teammate TACO eliminates the last standing member of team liquid.


They go on to win that major, many thanks to this play. Highlights like this are what most people watch competitive e-sports for, and if you watch the highlight, you can hear how the crowd loves the play, and the casters are impressed.
 
Most players playing Counter Strike, have these moments themselves, perhaps with less on the line, but the feeling of holding down a part of the map by yourself, is a great feeling. Some people compile all of their best moments into a highlight reel to upload for people to see. Our question is, can we find these highlights by analyzing the game, and find better highlights for a given round, in a given game from a given player. We are going to research if that is possible, how that could be done, and if players opinions of that makes a good highlight differ depending on their knowledge of the game.


A highlight is when something extraordinary occurs during a time period or an event. In the case of Counter-Strike 2 a highlight could be a multitude of things, for example a round when a player kills multiple players in one round or a player kills more than one player with one bullet or a single utility. 


A lot of things occur during a Counter-Strike 2 match, meaning it can be hard to decide what highlight is better than another. In a single game, multiple highlight worthy moments might happen, such as in one round a player might eliminate the whole enemy team, while in another round a player might kill three players with one grenade. It is here the algorithm comes in and values each play with different metrics and can decide which round would be better to make a highlight out of.


\section{Defining the scope of your thesis}
This thesis studies the possibilities of automating the process of finding and selecting highlights in Counter-Strike 2.  Can we develop algorithms to analyze gameplay data, recognize impressive plays, and even rate them based on objective criteria?  Also, how do player opinions of what constitutes a "better" highlight differ based on their level of skill?  By researching these topics, we seek to discover new opportunities for improving the spectator experience, rewarding individual performance, and deepening our understanding of the components that contribute to a truly awesome highlight.
